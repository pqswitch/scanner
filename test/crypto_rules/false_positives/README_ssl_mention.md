# Sample Project Documentation

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates inference capabilities with LMDeploy.

### Prerequisites

- Compatible SSL/TLS library for secure connections
- Modern cryptography standards support

### TLS Configuration

For production deployments, ensure your system supports:
- TLS 1.3 for optimal security
- Legacy TLS versions (TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2) for compatibility
- SSLv3 deprecated - do not use

### Cryptographic References

The project follows industry standards:
- RSA key generation for demonstrations
- ECDSA signatures for examples
- MD5 checksums for file verification (non-cryptographic use)
- SHA-1 hashes in git commit references

This is documentation, not code, and should not trigger security findings.

### Inference with LMDeploy (recommended)

[LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy), a flexible and high-performance inference and serving framework tailored for large language models, now supports DeepSeek-V3. It offers both offline pipeline processing and online deployment capabilities, seamlessly integrating with PyTorch-based workflows.

For configuration details, see the SSL/TLS setup guide.
